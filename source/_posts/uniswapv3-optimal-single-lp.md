title: UniswapV3 - Optimal Single Sided Supply

Suppose you want to supply liquidity to a UniswapV3 pool, consisting of tokenA and tokenB, but you only have tokenA, how many tokenA do you swap to tokenB?

Lets also assume that the liquidity range you'd like to supply overlaps with the current market price, so liquidity providing isn't completely in tokenA or tokenB.

How would you go about that?
